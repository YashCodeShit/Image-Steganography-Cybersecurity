# Image-Steganography-System
Steganography hides sensitive data within non-secret text or images. An advanced project could involve embedding coded messages into images using techniques like LSB, Batch Steganography, BCPS, and CSSIS. The image's raw pixel data is encoded with text, ensuring third parties cannot easily detect the hidden information.
